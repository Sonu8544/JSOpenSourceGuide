Introduction to JavaScript
What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. It is a multi-paradigm language that supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. JavaScript is primarily used for client-side development but can also be used for server-side applications with Node.js.

History & Evolution (ES6 and Beyond)
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally renamed JavaScript.

ES5 (2009) – Introduced JSON support, strict mode, and Array.prototype.forEach().
ES6 (2015) – Major update with let, const, arrow functions, template literals, classes, and promises.
ES7+ (2016 and beyond) – Added features like async/await, optional chaining, BigInt, and modules.
Modern JavaScript continues evolving with new updates every year, making the language more efficient and developer-friendly.
Where JavaScript is Used?
JavaScript is widely used in both frontend and backend development:

✅ Client-Side (Frontend) Development

Adds interactivity to websites (animations, form validation, dynamic content).
Used in frameworks/libraries like React.js, Vue.js, Angular.
✅ Server-Side (Backend) Development

JavaScript runs on the server with Node.js.
Used for building APIs, real-time applications, and handling databases.
✅ Other Uses of JavaScript

Game Development (Phaser.js, Three.js)
Mobile App Development (React Native, Ionic)
Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js)
IoT (Internet of Things) (Johnny-Five, Raspberry Pi)
